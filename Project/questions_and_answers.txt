   A) Photosynthesis
   B) Fermentation
   ✅ C) Cellular respiration
   D) Transpiration

💡 Explanation: Cellular respiration is the process that breaks down glucose using oxygen to release energy, which is the opposite of photosynthesis that creates glucose.

---

3️⃣ RELATIONAL LEVEL
Question: How are photosynthesis and cellular respiration related in terms of their chemical equations?
   A) They use identical reactants and products
   B) They are completely unrelated processes
   ✅ C) They are opposite processes - products of one become reactants of the other
   D) Photosynthesis only occurs in plants while respiration only occurs in animals

💡 Explanation: Photosynthesis produces glucose and oxygen (using CO2 and water), while cellular respiration uses glucose and oxygen to produce CO2 and water. The products of each process serve as reactants for the other, creating a complementary cycle in nature.

4️⃣ EXTENDED ABSTRACT LEVEL
Question: A sealed biodome experiment shows dangerously rising CO2 levels and declining oxygen. The system contains both plants and animals. Which modification would BEST restore balance and why?
   A) Add more animals to consume excess CO2
   B) Remove all animals to eliminate CO2 production
   ✅ C) Increase plant population and lighting intensity
   D) Seal the system further to prevent gas exchange

💡 Explanation: Increasing plants and light intensity maximizes photosynthesis (6CO2 + 6H2O + light → C6H12O6 + 6O2), directly addressing both problems: consuming excess CO2 and producing needed oxygen. This applies understanding of the photosynthesis equation to solve an environmental crisis through biological processes.

2️⃣ MULTISTRUCTURAL LEVEL
Question: Which of the following represents the correct order of energy transfer in a food chain?
   ✅ A) Producer → Primary consumer → Secondary consumer → Tertiary consumer
   B) Primary consumer → Producer → Secondary consumer → Tertiary consumer
   C) Tertiary consumer → Secondary consumer → Primary consumer → Producer
   D) Producer → Tertiary consumer → Secondary consumer → Primary consumer

💡 Explanation: Energy flows from producers (plants) to primary consumers (herbivores), then to secondary consumers (carnivores), and finally to tertiary consumers (top predators), following the direction of energy transfer in ecosystems.

---

3️⃣ RELATIONAL LEVEL
Question: How does biodiversity affect ecosystem stability during environmental changes?
   A) Higher biodiversity makes ecosystems more fragile and vulnerable
   B) Biodiversity has no relationship with ecosystem stability
   ✅ C) Higher biodiversity increases ecosystem resilience and recovery ability
   D) Only plant biodiversity matters for ecosystem stability

💡 Explanation: Ecosystems with higher biodiversity have more species interactions and redundancy, meaning if some species are affected by environmental changes, others can fill similar ecological roles. This interconnectedness and species variety provide multiple pathways for energy flow and nutrient cycling, making the ecosystem more resilient to disturbances.

4️⃣ EXTENDED ABSTRACT LEVEL
Question: Climate change is causing ocean acidification, which dissolves calcium carbonate shells of marine organisms. Predict the cascading effects on marine food webs and propose a conservation strategy.
   A) Only shell-forming organisms will be affected, with minimal ecosystem impact
   ✅ B) Shell-forming organisms decline → reduced food for fish → collapsed marine food chains → implement marine protected areas with pH monitoring
   C) Ocean acidification will increase fish populations by eliminating shell competition
   D) The problem will self-correct through natural adaptation

💡 Explanation: Shell-forming organisms (like plankton, mollusks) are foundation species in marine food webs. Their decline removes crucial food sources for fish, leading to population crashes that ripple through trophic levels. Marine protected areas with pH monitoring can provide refugia where ecosystems can maintain stability while broader climate solutions are implemented, applying ecosystem interdependence principles to conservation planning.

2️⃣ MULTISTRUCTURAL LEVEL
Question: Which body systems are primarily responsible for transporting materials throughout the body?
   A) Nervous and muscular systems
   ✅ B) Circulatory and respiratory systems
   C) Digestive and excretory systems
   D) Skeletal and immune systems

💡 Explanation: The circulatory system transports blood, nutrients, and oxygen throughout the body, while the respiratory system facilitates gas exchange and oxygen transport to the bloodstream.

---

3️⃣ RELATIONAL LEVEL
Question: Explain how the respiratory system and circulatory system work together to maintain vital functions in the human body.
   A) Respiratory system pumps blood while circulatory system absorbs nutrients
   ✅ B) Circulatory system delivers oxygen from lungs to cells while respiratory system removes CO2 waste
   C) Both systems independently regulate body temperature through gas exchange
   D) Respiratory system produces blood cells while circulatory system filters air

💡 Explanation: The respiratory system oxygenates blood through lungs, while the circulatory system transports this oxygen to cells via blood vessels and returns CO2 waste to lungs for expulsion - demonstrating system interdependence.

4️⃣ EXTENDED ABSTRACT LEVEL
Question: A patient's nervous system suddenly loses all function due to an injury. Predict how this would impact two other body systems and explain the chain of effects using system interdependence principles.
   A) Only muscular system affected - muscles couldn't move without nerve signals
   ✅ B) Circulatory and respiratory systems - heart would stop beating rhythmically and breathing would cease without neural control
   C) Digestive system exclusively - peristalsis requires nervous system coordination

💡 Explanation: The nervous system controls automatic functions like heart rhythm (circulatory system) and breathing rate (respiratory system) through the brainstem. Without neural control, these vital functions would immediately fail, demonstrating critical interdependence where one system's failure cascades to others. The circulatory system's failure would then prevent oxygen delivery to all cells, including those in other systems.

3️⃣ RELATIONAL LEVEL
Question: How does sexual reproduction affect genetic variation compared to asexual reproduction?
   A) Sexual reproduction produces genetically identical offspring, while asexual reproduction increases variation
   B) Both reproduction types result in similar levels of genetic variation
   ✅ C) Sexual reproduction increases genetic variation through recombination, whereas asexual reproduction produces clones with little variation
   D) Asexual reproduction requires more energy but increases genetic diversity

💡 Explanation: Sexual reproduction creates genetic variation through processes like meiosis (crossing over) and random fertilization, combining DNA from two parents. Asexual reproduction produces genetically identical offspring (clones) through mitosis, limiting genetic diversity. This relationship explains why sexually reproducing species adapt better to environmental changes.

4️⃣ EXTENDED ABSTRACT LEVEL
Question: A biotechnology company wants to modify a crop plant's DNA to make it drought-resistant by altering specific nitrogenous base sequences. Which tool should they prioritize using and why?
   ✅ A) CRISPR gene editing technology
   B) Traditional selective breeding programs
   C) Genetic counseling techniques
   D) DNA fingerprinting analysis

💡 Explanation: CRISPR allows precise modification of DNA base sequences (A-T-G-C) to introduce drought-resistant traits, applying knowledge of DNA structure to directly edit genetic instructions. This addresses the problem at the molecular level unlike selective breeding (B) which relies on phenotypic selection over generations. Neither genetic counseling (C) nor DNA fingerprinting (D) enable intentional DNA modification.
